# tdd-snapshot.sh — the approved snapshot of tests/ and docs/product/ for /tdd.
# ADR-0016 Stage 1, item 5 (meta/adr/ADR-0016-loop-engineering-stage1.md).
#
#   record : at Gate 4 approval — copy tests/ and docs/product/ into
#            $(git rev-parse --git-path claude-tdd)/approved/ (inside .git/, never committed).
#            A new approval replaces the previous copy.
#   verify : after Green — compare the current files with the copy (diff -r) and print any
#            difference. The comparison never goes through git, so neither `git add` nor git
#            filters (.gitattributes clean filters) can hide a change.
#
# Run by the main session (not by tdd-implementer). Deterministic: bash + cp + diff, no AI.
#
# Exit code (same meaning as the gate contract, meta/design/gate-contract.md):
#   0 = unchanged since approval, 2 = changed (diff printed), 3 = no snapshot / usage error.
