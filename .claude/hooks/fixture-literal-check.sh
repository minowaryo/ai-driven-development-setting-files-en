# fixture-literal-check.sh — did the implementer hard-code the tests' data in application code?
# Design: meta/design/fixture-literal-check.md (ADR-0017 outcome, prerequisite 1).
#
# After Green, /tdd runs this next to tdd-snapshot.sh. It prints every place where a line
# ADDED to application code (app/, routes/, config/, database/, resources/) compares against a
# quoted string that
#   - appears in the approved test files (the Gate 4 snapshot), and
#   - appears nowhere in the approved spec (docs/product/*.md in the snapshot), and
#   - did not exist in the application code before the cycle (git HEAD).
# A comparison or branch is ===, ==, !==, !=, case, match, in_array( or a where(/firstWhere( call.
# That is how "make the test pass" is faked: `if ($product->sku === 'SKU-A')`. The agent's own
# report is never read. Numbers are out of scope (too common in legitimate code).
#
# Added lines = tracked changes against HEAD plus every line of untracked new files. HEAD is
# taken as the cycle start: /tdd does not commit between Gate 4 and this check.
#
# Run by the main session after Green. Deterministic: bash + git + awk + grep, no AI.
# Exit code (meta/design/gate-contract.md): 0 = no hit, 2 = hit (printed), 3 = cannot run.
